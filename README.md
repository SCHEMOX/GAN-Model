# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating synthetic images. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator trained adversarially to create realistic images.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are deep learning models that consist of a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, and the discriminator evaluates how realistic the generated data is compared to real data. The models are trained adversarially, leading to improved generation capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before using this GAN model, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the pre-trained generator model to generate images, run the following script:

```bash
python generate_images.py
```

This script will load the pre-trained generator model, generate images, and display them.

## Training

If you want to train the GAN model from scratch or continue training, use the following command:

```bash
python train_gan.py
```

Adjust the training parameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate, in the `train_gan.py` script.

## Generated Images

You can find sample generated images in the `generated_images` folder. These images are produced by the pre-trained generator model.

## Model Files

- `generator.h5`: Pre-trained generator model file.
- `discriminator.h5`: Pre-trained discriminator model file.

You can use these model files for generating new images or evaluating the model.
