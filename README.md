# Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) Implementation with TensorFlow/Keras

Welcome to the Wasserstein GAN repository! This GitHub project contains a detailed implementation of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) using TensorFlow and Keras. WGAN is a variant of GANs designed to address training stability issues and mode collapse, providing a more reliable approach to generating realistic data.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Implementation:** The repository includes a complete implementation of WGAN, covering the creation of both the generator and critic networks, the Wasserstein loss function, and the training loop.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** The implementation leverages the popular deep learning frameworks TensorFlow and Keras, making it accessible and easy to understand for those familiar with these tools.
- **MNIST Dataset:** The code is accompanied by the use of the MNIST dataset for simplicity, allowing users to quickly grasp the key concepts and apply the implementation to other datasets as needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Wasserstein-GAN.git](https://github.com/SCHEMOX/Wasserstein-Generative-Adversarial-Network-WGAN.git
   
   cd Wasserstein-Generative-Adversarial-Network-WGAN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore the code, run training, and generate images.
